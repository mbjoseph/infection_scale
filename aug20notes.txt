Joint influences of host diversity and spatial scale or number of sites in a region

Disagreement stems from different scales:
- dilution depends on species intxns = local scales
@ larger scales, expect other processes that swamp out effects of local intxns

Birds as a process - what sites are visited

Colonization vs. transmission & abundance

Region richness -> rib occurrence & mean intensity

Intxn between ISD and regional richness:
- does colonization effect persist & transmission effect disappear?
